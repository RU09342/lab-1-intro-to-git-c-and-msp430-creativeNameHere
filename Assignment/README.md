# Lab 1

For this lab, I created a math.c based on the provided math.h.

The math.h specified a function math which took in two numbers and a character, and output the solution based on the inputs. To achieve this, I used a simple switch statement, achieving different outputs depending on what character is input. This allowed me to handle any problems resulting from an invalid character, by simply returning whatever I choose, in this case 0.
